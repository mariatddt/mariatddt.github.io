                <p class="text-muted mt-3">Since early childhood, I have been mesmerized by numbers - how ten simple digits manage to explain so many world phenomena. So, it was no surprise that Mathematics, and later on Informatics were so formative in my academic life. My dedication and endless fascination with the discipline that is Informatics showcase the different aspects of my personality. <br> <b> <u>Ambition</u></b> <br> Competition is my second nature. Since preschool, I have been taking part in mathematical olympiads. Later on, I switched the discipline, but the goal remained the same - to be better. Not better than everyone else - better than my previous self. I have won dozens of medals, met the most wonderful teammates, and learned to push, even if it seems that you can't do it. My efforts culminated in my selection for the Bulgarian girls' team. <br> <b> <u>Creativity</u></b> <br> Although my main area of interest is back-end programming, front-end programming allows me to bring a touch of my uniqueness to my projects, thus making them a mirror of my personality. That is why web development has become a significant part of my coding experience. I have designed a website for a small business in Varna, promoting simultaneously my work and theirs. I have also taken part in multiple coding projects in the department for Girls Who Code. <br> <b> <u>Intellectual curiosity</u></b><br> Furthermore, my main goal is to incorporate programming into other parts of life, making it socially beneficial. That is why I have used my machine learning and data analysis skills to research different discriminatory patterns in Africa, and their impact on the community, and more specifically the women there. In the future, I want to improve these abilities of mine and perfect an algorithm that will ease communication and increase the overall standard of living for people with impediments. <br> <b> <u>Education</u></b><br> I have always understood the material best upon retelling it to somebody else. I am a natural teacher - for me explaining a concept is like building a path towards the unknown for the person sitting across. Allowing as many children as possible to explore the ocean that is programming is essential in an innovative society. That is why I have worked with kids from disadvantaged families to guide them in the journey of Informatics. I also helped host an exchange program for students from minorities in Romania, contributing to their understanding of multiculturalism as well as technical skills.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-muted mt-3">My journey as a debater and public speaker has been parallel to my personal growth throughout high school. This passion of mine pushed me to evolve both as a communicator and as a person. It showed me the real meaning of community and helped me develop my leadership skills. <br> <b> <u> 2020/2021</u></b> <br> Just starting high school in a completely new surrounding, I was lost. This is when I first encountered debates and learned the British Parliamentary debate style, which immediately intrigued me. Just one month into debating, I eagerly participated in my first tournament. Sadly, due to COVID, I didn't have the chance to fully delve into competitive debating. <br> <b> <u> 2021/2022</u></b> <br> Back in Varna, I accidentally stamped across a debate meeting of our school's team - a part of BEST Foundation, which organizes speech and World Schools Debate tournaments in English in Bulgaria. There, I discovered the thrill of public speaking, the importance of qualitative preparation, the value of teamwork, the bitterness of losing, and the excitement of winning. My new team and I got to finals on our first competition together, and as for me - I won an award for Original Oratory in every tournament of the year, as well as two Best Speaker awards. However, the sense of community was still missing... <br> <b> <u> 2022/2023</u></b> <br> Throughout the summer I attended the Debate Summer Camp, and that is when I knew I finally fit in. I got to know tens of debaters from all around Bulgaria, but most importantly I found my people - the ones that would make losing a debate motivational, preparation - exceptional, and debating together - a spark of joy. In our first year in Varsity Debate, the odds were not in our favor. However, with dedication and hard work, we did the unbelievable - won first place twice, and I was appointed the Best Speaker once again. Meanwhile, I continued developing my Oratory skills and getting closer and closer to the BEST community. <br> <b> <u>2023/2024</u></b> <br> This was the year I truly evolved as a person. I became the team's Student Leader - responsible for recruiting, guiding, and helping the team members. For me, improvement was essential. That is why I started a weekly seminar and TED Talk program, allowing my teammates to perform and improve, whilst providing a source of entertainment to my hometown as well. This year taught me the true meaning of the word "leader" - I felt ecstatic whenever my teammates won, and relived their losses with them. In the end, we won the Best Team award, which was my most fulfilling achievement of all. Other than that, I was selected for BEST Foundation's international debate team and improved my skills immensely. I had the opportunity to take part in university-level international competitions, and later on, share new knowledge with my teammates. My successes in Original Oratory continued as well, and by the end of the year, I had become the foundation's most-awarded speaker. As for my debate team, our proudest moment was not winning, but feedback from a judge: "I dread every time I have to judge you since it seems that you know more about debates than I do." <br> <b> <u> 2024/2025</u></b> <br>This year will be my last one both in high school and in BEST. I will be the team's coach, preparing and teaching my fellow debaters and speakers. This is a time for reflection on my growth from an individualistic child into a community-focused individual, and for improvement of my debate skills and public speaking even further. After all, there are many more hills to climb. </p>

                <p class="text-muted mt-3">People are social creatures, and I am no exception. My outgoing personality has manifested itself into a deep care, appreciation, and sense of belonging towards my community on a school, regional, and national level. This can be seen from my engagement in community-focused initiatives. <br> <b> <u>USYC</u></b> <br> The United States Ambassador's Youth Council is a non-governmental organization, aiming to unite proactive, innovative, and dedicated young adults and involve them in different workshops and charity organizations. This creates a strong network of community-focused people, trying to improve their surroundings. By attending monthly meetings, the Council concentrates on pressing issues in Bulgaria, advises the Ambassador on youth-related policies, and promotes democratic values and core human rights. My involvement with the Council was pioneering in my region, later on paving the way for other students to get involved as well. <br> <b> <u>PTPI The Dolphins</u></b> <br> One of the most charitable initiatives in Varna is the Christmas campaign of PTPI The Dolphins, consisting of making and later on selling the hand-made Christmas cards. This is always on my December to-do list, giving me a sense of fulfillment before this holly holiday.<br> <b> <u>Informal Education & Entrepreneurship</u></b> <br> I have taken part in multiple forums, aiming to promote critical thinking, active leadership, business knowledge, and many other skills that are sadly not taught in a traditional classroom. The forums involve many workshops, as well as bigger team projects in the form of a start-up. With only a few days to prepare, this task tests my efficacy, ability to think on the spot, and determination to succeed. After I partake, I return to my hometown with a clear purpose - to spread what I have learned with my classmates, making both me and them more prepared for life after graduation. <br> <b> <u>Model Republic of Bulgaria</u></b> <br> MUN through the Bulgarian prism, Model Republic of Bulgaria is a simulation of our country's government in a time of crisis such as the current one. In my opinion, citizens of a nation with an unstable political situation like mine should prioritize education and a thorough understanding of the political sphere. That is why I participated in and popularized the event, aiming to broaden my horizons. For my excessive research and hard work, I was awarded Best Journalist of the event.</p>

Furthermore, I have taught Russian to my classmates on occasion and taken part in the school's annual multicultural fairs.

This knowledge is key in today's world of globalization.<br> <b><u>How?</u></b><br> I have taken part in History olympiads, as well as chosen History as my Advanced class in school.

I have found friends, who enjoy this activity as well, and during wintertime, we go at least once a week.
